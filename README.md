# Playground Website / Informatics project

A __dynamic__ website where users can add, view and rate playgrounds. The playgrounds are shown on a map.
Originally made for an informatics project for school with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PhP & MySQL. Later expanded into a commercial project. (I hope we can refund the hosting costs). It will be published soon!
